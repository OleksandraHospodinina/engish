                  Teachers at English Spirit school are very professional and
                  qualified. They create a pleasant and friendly atmosphere,
                  which allows students to feel confident and comfortable during
                  their studies. Each lesson was well-planned and structured,
                  which helped me effectively absorb new material. The school
                  offers a variety of English language learning programs that
                  allow students to choose a course that best suits their goals
                  and language level. Additionally, the teaching materials used
                  at the school are always current and interesting. I want to
                  note that after completing the course, my English language
                  skills significantly improved. I can now communicate in
                  English freely and easily understand native speakers.

                  appreciated the opportunity to communicate with other students
                  in English. It was very beneficial for me as I could practice
                  my English in an informal setting and learn to speak more
                  freely. In conclusion, thanks to English Spirit school, I have
                  significantly improved my English language skills and feel

                  I have been traveling around the world for several years and
                  always dreamed of learning English so that communication would
                  not be a barrier for me. When I visited English Spirit school,
                  I realized it was the best decision I could make. I was very

                  of the teachers at the school. They were experienced and
                  caring, always ready to help me. I liked how they structured
                  their lessons, including a combination of different teaching
                  methods such as watching shows, listening to podcasts,
                  discussing absolutely all the interesting topics for me, and
                  learning to communicate through SMS. This helped me better
                  understand the language and quickly absorb new material.

                  I am very happy that my parents enrolled me in English Spirit
                  school to prepare for the English language SAT. Thanks to the
                  professionalism of the teachers and the individual approach to
                  each student, I was able to successfully pass the SAT with a
                  score of 194. The lessons at the school were interesting and
                  exciting. Teachers used various teaching methods to help me
                  better understand grammar and English language rules. They
                  also provided me with numerous opportunities to practice
                  spoken language, which was crucial for successfully passing
                  the exam. I especially liked that teachers at the school
                  focused not only on theory but also on the practical
                  application of knowledge. They taught me to use the language
                  in real life, not just on the exam. Thanks to this, I was able
                  to better understand English and use it in everyday life.
